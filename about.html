              <p>
                I’m a product designer with 4 years of experience crafting
                intuitive solutions for product analytics tools. In my last
                position I was a product designer at Heap Analytics where I was
                part of the Insights team which focuses on the data
                visualization and analysis areas of the platform. Before that, I
                led the end-to-end design of data visualization and analysis
                features for Auryc's analytics suite.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I am not designing I love creating art. Last year my
                brother and I were

                  organization SJ Walls.
                </a>
                I also love to cook. My partners family is from India, so
                recently I’ve been trying to get more familiar cooking Indian
                dishes.

                <h3>Bridging the Gap</h3>

                <p>
                  Having a basic understanding of HTML/CSS (currently taking a
                  JavaScript course with the goal of learning React) has allowed
                  me to communicate with developers in their language, make sure
                  designs are up to spec through QA, and overall make
                  collaboration more effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With React my goal is to help accelerate development and
                  enable faster iteration on design ideas by participating in
                  the development phase .

                <h3>Visual Design</h3>

                <p>
                  With a B.A. in Visual Studies and a background in art, I bring
                  a high level of visual design and attention to detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These skills have enabled me to collaborate with marketing and
                  sales teams, create designs that drive consistency and push
                  the company's brand aesthetic forward.
