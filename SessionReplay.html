              Heap was in its early stages of developing a native session replay

                  <p>
                    Heap’s session player lacked crucial information required
                    for support teams to easily transition into analysis,
                    troubleshoot issues, and assess impact.

                  <h3>What's session replay?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Session replay allows you to troubleshoot issues and improve
                    the user experience by allowing you to watch a video of
                    exactly what a user did on your website or application.

              My experience at Auryc and past market research gave me a deep
              understanding of the value of session replay for support teams. I
              saw firsthand how important it is to provide more context than
              just the recording, which helped me arrive at some quick
              solutions.

                <p>
                  We need to display actions in the player in a way that is both
                  flexible and informative. The display should distinguish
                  actions from defined events so that users can understand the
                  limitations of the player and avoid confusion. Once the data
                  matches defined events, other analysis features can be easily
                  introduced.

                <p>
                  Defined events are user actions within a product that have
                  been named and tracked by your team to understand user
                  behavior and identify trends. In Heap defined events are the
                  building blocks to any type of analysis.

                  <p>
                    Designs for an event lists with a vertical timeline were
                    created based on leadership feedback, the goal was to
                    establish a stronger connection between the elements in the
                    event list and what was happening in the session.

                  <p>
                    We agreed that the timeline was helpful, but not necessary,
                    as the animation of the event list could also provide the
                    same affordance. Therefore, we dropped the idea and did not
                    include it in the MVP.

              Once the team agreed to move forward with the two-piece event
              list, I created a final prototype that implemented all the
              feedback I had collected thus far. I reviewed once more, walked
              engineering through all the different interactions in detail, and
              development began.

              The new player was successfully launched in September 2022. In the
              following months, there was a spike in session replay usage, and
              we saw an increase in customers switching to us from their current
              session replay tool.

              I was excited to take on this project as my first impactful
              contribution to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the chaotic environment of an acquisition, I was able to
              quickly adapt and integrate into a new team, adopt its dynamics
              and build strong relationships through consistent communication,
              proactivity, and welcoming feedback and new perspectives, all
              while remaining positive about the challenges ahead.

                <p>
                  I believe that I could have expedited the decision-making
                  process and brought these new features to market faster by
                  presenting Auryc customer testimonials and data that backed up
                  the success of these features in the Auryc player to Heap
                  stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately, it was difficult to gather this information
                  amidst Auryc's integration into Heap.

                <h3>What Went Well</h3>

                <p>
                  It was a great learning experience to be introduced to a
                  different collaboration process at Heap. Processes vary
                  depending on the company's size and goals, so it was
                  interesting to see how things are done at a larger scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was also able to work with a design team for the first time,
                  which was a new experience for me. I had only worked with one
                  other designer previously, so hearing from 10 other talented
                  designers and getting their feedback really opened my eyes to
                  different ways of thinking about solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Everyone has their own approach, and I learned a lot from
                  everyone's reasoning and decision-making during the design
                  workshops I brought this project into.
